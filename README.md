Security Software Subterfuge Standard
=====================================

* _The VT counterattack_: Our heuristics would catch the bastard!
* _Not Our Problem_: We can't do anything after the infection occurs, we only work on prevention!
* _We got Threat Intel_: We couldn't catch the infection, but we would've caught the C&C communication!
* _The APT Argument_: This is a highly sophisticated / state sponsored attack!
* _We have an app for that_: The victim didn't use the most expensive version of our product!
* _Pay Us More_: Our product has not been installed and configured by our experts!
* _We told you so_: But our product did alert the customer that there was a malware infection!
* _Gold Certification_: But this study proves that our product rocks!
* _Ad hominem_: You are trying to undermine the security of our users!!!1
* _Magic stone_: It's still better than nothing!
* _Stuxnet_: But we were the ones who found X targeted malware!
* _Almighty cloud_: There was a transient issue in our cloud system!
* _Not our fault_: There was a third-party software on the system which interfered with our protection!
